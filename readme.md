### Analyzing bikeshare-data with Python
A simple terminal program that analyzes bikeshare-data from three different files

### Description
This terminal program calculates statistical values from bikeshare-data from three different US-cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington. The programs prompts the user to select one city and then asks for time filters (month and day). If requested, the program displays five rows of raw data at a time.

This project was part of [Udacity's 'Programming for Data Science with Python'-Nanodegree](https://www.udacity.com/course/programming-for-data-science-nanodegree--nd104).

### Files used
The data used is available either as cleaned CSV-files on [Udacity's homepage of the program](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd104/parts/cd0419/modules/055dc421-68ae-4629-822a-382ae4fe25a8/lessons/e859c8e3-d642-490a-81cf-1886f48a9334/concepts/81111c19-0a15-4bd9-984b-37f08d32112f) or as raw data on the bikeshare-provider's homepage for [Chicago](https://www.divvybikes.com/system-data), [New York City](https://ride.citibikenyc.com/system-data), and [Washington](https://www.capitalbikeshare.com/system-data).
